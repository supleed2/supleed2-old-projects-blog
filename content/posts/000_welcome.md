# Welcome to my site

Initially, I just wanted my own domain, to experiment with domains and secure
communication as well as learn how DNS works.\
I then realised that it was the perfect excuse to host my own site and what
better use than to showcase the things I've built.

And so, I've started this site, as a way to practice documenting my work and
other thoughts I may have too.

Below are links to writeups or relevant resources I've found helpful.
